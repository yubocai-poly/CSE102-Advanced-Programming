# Exercise 4
"""
General setup: a universityâ€™s curriculum consists of courses (numbered from 0 to n). 
Each course has prerequisites (other courses that should be passed before enrolling into the course). 
In the problems below, you will be given a graph G of courses (with edges from a course to all its prerequisites)
represented via adjacency list.

    """
    Write a function required(G, c) that takes a course number c 
    and returns the number of courses that have to be passed in order to pass c (including c itself).
    
    For example, required([[1], [2, 3], [], [2], [2]], 1) should return 3.
